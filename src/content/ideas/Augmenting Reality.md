As a student studying CS and CG, most of the technology I come across aims to replicate or replace parts of reality. I wanted to make a space that reverses this paradigm.

This collection of micro-interactions explores ways to use real-world interaction as the primary experience, while digital tools augment perception. Each idea centers the user in their surroundingsâ€”looking up, looking around, or connecting with someone nearâ€”while the device quietly listens, reflects, or responds.

*brain dump of ideas*

## Skygazing

- **Compass**  
  create a frame with real world api data of sun position, direction, time until sunset, or moon phase. see the conditions affecting the sky color via light physics using the NOAA weather api.

## Colors
discovering form and harmony in colors.

- **Path**  
  with webcam, logs dominant colors as you move. Generates a gradient or abstract visual from your path.

- **Palette**  
  a way to qualify a user-chosen color in a way that adds depth to it, for example an LLM generated description or a shared archive of colors and descriptors.

## People
deepen human connection through a virtual facilitator
- **Heartbeat Sync**  
  Each person places a finger on their camera. App detects pulse, syncs it as vibration or light.

- **Shared Object Reflection**  
  Scan the same real-world object. Each person answers a prompt. The device blends responses into a poem or shape.

- **Body as Interface**  
  using a frontend-hosted computer vision library, detect hand movements or facial expression of two people
