description: "[under construction] shifting perspectives"

As a student studying CS and CG, most of the technology I come across aims to replicate or replace parts of reality that we can also simply look up or around to experience. 

I want to make a growing collection of micro-interactions that instead deepens the experience of our immediate reality, using physical interaction as the primary experience while digital tools augment perception.

*brain dump of ideas*

- **Skygazing/Compass**  
  create a frame with real world api data of sun position, direction, time until sunset, or moon phase. see the conditions affecting the sky color via light physics using the NOAA weather api.

- **Shared Object Reflection**  
  Two people scan the same real-world object. Each person answers a prompt. A machine learning model blends responses into a shared poem or shape.

- **Body as Interface**  
  using a frontend-hosted computer vision library, detect hand movements or facial expression of two people to create collaborative art on screen.
