## Chapter 1: Strategy, Markets, and Competition

### Strategic vs. Tactical Decisions

|                       | Strategic Decisions                                                              | Tactical (& Operational/Functional) Decisions                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Management            | top management/BoD                                                               | mid-level/functional/local                                                      |
| Resources             | corporate                                                                         | divisional, departmental                                                        |
| Time frame            | long term                                                                         | short term                                                                       |
| Risk                  | success or survival                                                               | limited                                                                          |
| Questions             | What business do we want to be in?<br>What critical competencies must develop?<br>How are we going to deal with competitors? | How do we improve delivery times?<br>What is the best career path for our sales reps? |

Decisions that may not seem strategic may have big impacts  
IBM outsourcing operating system/production resulted in Microsoft and Intel

So, what really is strategic? > decisions whose results depend on the actions and reactions of other economic entities; tactical decisions can be made in isolation and hinge on implementation

Strategic issues involve:  
- Selecting arena (market) of competition  
- Management of external market agents (anticipate and control)

According to Michael Porter, 5 factors affect industry‚Äôs competitive environment: Substitutes, Suppliers, Potential Entrants, Buyers, and Competitors  
But most important factor is barriers to entry (potential entrants)

If firm finds success > more firms will enter, creating commoditized market and zero profit, firms must compete with operational efficiency (internal/tactical)  
Existence of barriers to entry means that incumbent firm can do what rivals cannot, both original firm and successful entrant can be incumbent

### Competitive Advantage

Competitive advantages that lead to market dominance are often rooted in local advantage (geographical like Walmart or product like Microsoft or Intel) and expand outward

Only 3 kinds of genuine competitive advantage (likely to be most present in locality):  
- Supply: services delivered cheaper (proprietary technology or privileged access to inputs)  
- Demand: customer captivity based on habit, costs of switching, or difficulties searching for a substitute provider  
- Economies of scale: large fixed cost > cost per unit declines as volume increases  

Sometimes, government protection or superior access to information may be advantageous

### Competitive Landscape

In situation where large firm (elephant) dominates and smaller firms (ants) struggle with barriers, ants should get out as painlessly as possible and look elsewhere  
Elephant should understand and manage advantages (sustaining, sources/limitations)  

If multiple comparable competitors, regional advantages/indirect competition may allow firms to coexist in success (here, strategy formation is intense, must manage competitors)

Features of competitive situation:  
- The players (if list is not short/manageable, no genuine barriers to entry)  
- The actions (choices available to each player)  
- The motives (profitability, winning against competitors regardless of cost)  
- The rules (timing, relationships, penalties)

Fundamental dynamics of competitive situations can be captured by Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma (competition that concerns price and quality) + quantity and capacity competition (entry/preemption in competitive markets)

Cooperative analysis of situations that benefit all can add bargaining perspective to complement

## Chapter 2 (Competitive Advantages I): Supply and Demand

### The Differentiation Myth

Avoid commodity businesses  
Differentiation doesn‚Äôt help much here, problem is lack of barriers to entry (Cadillac and Mercedes Benz originally dominated markets, but other luxury car brands entered and even while maintaining high prices, sales and market share declined/fixed costs stagnated > profitability declined slowly until financial returns in the market normalized)  
If no forces interfere with entry, profitability will decline until efficient firms can‚Äôt earn more than ‚Äònormal‚Äô return on invested capital  

Product differentiation is like efficiency in that it requires investments and increases performance but not enough return to retaliate against expansive pushes by successful companies  

‚ÄúNormal‚Äù return: return to investors‚Äô capital should equal what investor can earn elsewhere (adjusted for risk), otherwise investors will withdraw capital  

### Barriers to Entry

Genuine barriers to entry are characteristics of structural economics of a particular market  
Much easier to make decision to enter than to exit > takes industry with excess capacity and below average returns to eliminate unnecessary assets than industry with above average returns to add capacity  

Barriers to entry synonymous to incumbent advantages, entrant advantages are different (if last firm always has advantage, there are no barriers to entry and no sustainable excess returns)  
Once entrant makes it into the market, it becomes an incumbent  
Firms bold enough to enter markets with barriers must devise plans to be tolerated

### Supply Advantages: Competitive Costs

- Product patent: Xerox (copiers), Kodak/Polaroid (film), pharmaceutical companies (medicines)  
- Process patent: Alcoa (aluminum), DuPont (chemicals)  

Patents generally expire after 17 years - but learning and experience reduce costs  
In the long run, everything is a toaster (no significant proprietary tech advantages)  
Cheap capital is not effective when company itself is not good  
Privileged access to raw materials or geographic location is usually restricted to locality

### Demand Advantages: Customer Captivity

Must have access to customers that rivals cannot match  
Limited number of reasons why customers become captive to one supplier:  
- Habit (Cigarette smokers and soda drinkers are brand loyal, while beer drinkers are not)  
- Habit holds customers captive when purchases are frequent and automatic  
- Usually local: limited to product and not portfolio  
- Switching Costs (associated with lawyers or software: retraining of people in firm who are users and increased error rate when a lot of core company data/ops are related)  
  - Standardization of products can break down this barrier (IBM)  
- Search Costs: more complicated, customized, and crucial > higher search cost  

Demand side advantages are more common/robust than supply side, but eventually fade over time

## Chapter 3 (Competitive Advantages II): Economies of Scale and Strategy

Linkage of economies of scale with customer captivity > truly durable advantage  
Competitive advantage of economies of scale depend on the market share difference of rivals  
If COGS declines then smaller rivals can‚Äôt compete unless they‚Äôre at the same scale  
Economies of scale must be coupled with incumbent customer captivity (even modest amount)  

Persistent entrants: Japanese entry into US car market, FujiFilm taking on Kodak  
Local markets > easier to create effective economies of scale barriers because small market

### Defending Economies of Scale

Best strategy for incumbents with EoS is to match the moves of competitors with greater investing power, customer relationships, and name value (Intel vs. AMD)  
Incumbents must emulate/neutralize competitor attacks, even in niche unexploited markets  
Pepsi gaining market share from supermarket sales, Japanese motorbikes vs. US  

Understand that EoS is created by market share in areas relevant to fixed cost, instead of sheer size (new regions or product lines that incur new fixed costs diminish EoS in the region)  
Growth of market is enemy of EoS: as market growth, FC remains constant while VC increase at least as fast as market > FC declines as percentage of TC and reduces incumbent advantage  
Most EoS advantage found in local, niche, and limited/fixed markets with substantial FC

### Strategy and Competitive Advantage Through Supply or Demand

- No competitive advantages in market: concentrate on efficiency  
- Advantages based on proprietary tech/customer captivity: exploit and reinforce while possible

**Exploit:** charging more if customer captivity, charging bit lower/same if cost advantage  
**Reinforce:**  
- Improve proprietary tech, produce more innovations to extend advantage  
- Encourage habit formation in new customers, increase switching costs, make search for alternatives complicated/difficult, spread out payments over time

### Strategy and Economies of Scale

EoS is in a class by themselves because:  
- Longer lived than cost or demand advantages  
- EoS advantages vulnerable to gradual erosion, need to be defended vigorously

For companies in market with significant FC but served by many small competitors:  
- Establish dominance in local market then expand outward (Wal-Mart/Microsoft strategy)  
- Both incumbents and entrants must identify attractive niche market (characterized by customer captivity, small size relative to FC, and absence of vigilant, dominant competitors, extendable)  
- Incumbents can increase FC > entrants can‚Äôt match (advertising, CapEx heavy production, R&D)

## Chapter 4: Assessing Competitive Advantages

### 3 Steps to Assess Competitive Advantage

1. **Landscape**: what markets is the firm really in? Who are competitors in each?  
2. **Existence**: Do incumbent firms maintain stable market shares? Are they exceptionally profitable over a substantial period?  
3. **Nature of Advantages**: Do incumbents have proprietary technologies or captive customers? Are there EoS or regulatory hurdles from which they benefit?

Develop industry map that shows structure of competition in relevant markets  
Market segments that make up industry + leading competitors in each  
Determine for each market segment whether it is protected by barriers to entry (does an incumbent enjoy advantages?)

2 telltale signs:  
- Stability of market share among firms (history of incumbents, entry/exit volume)  
- Profitability of firms within the segment (returns on capital substantially above what they have to pay, measured by returns on equity or capital for specific segments)

After-tax returns on invested capital topping 15‚Äì25% over a decade

## Case: Apple

### Industry Map

Map out segments:  
List names of firms in each segment, putting dominant company at the top

- No overlap between CPU and Manufacturing segments ‚Üí analyze each separately (IBM primarily uses Intel CPUs)
- Only 4 companies in CPU segment but long, incomplete list in Manufacturing (dominant firm not obvious)
- Consolidated Software and Applications due to Microsoft‚Äôs dominance

---

### Competitive Advantages: Chip Segment

- Market share has been stable since early 1980s after IBM‚Äôs industry-standardized PC
- Dominant supplier: **Intel** (90%, 2 decades)
- Other firms: IBM, NEC, Texas Instruments (unsuccessful in entry), Motorola/AMD (consistently fell behind)
- **Profitability**:
  - Intel‚Äôs ROIC (after tax) average exceeds 30%
  - Market value to replacement cost of net assets exceeds 3-to-1  
    ‚Üí For every $1 invested, $3 in shareholder value
- **Sources**:
  - Captive customers
  - Economies of Scale
  - Some patent protection (discussed earlier)

Apple is allied with Motorola and IBM ‚Üí disadvantaged due to Intel‚Äôs R&D-based EoS advantages  
Faced with a decision: either cut R&D or raise chip costs

---

### Competitive Advantages: Software Segment

- Dominant supplier: **Microsoft** (80‚Äì90% share in OS market for 2 decades)
- IBM‚Äôs open architecture ‚Üí allowed many manufacturers but standardized MS-DOS
- Microsoft defended core turf and expanded:
  - IBM tried to retake share
  - Apple initially led with graphical UI, but Microsoft succeeded with Windows (after MS-DOS)
- Also leads in:
  - Word processing
  - Spreadsheets
  - Presentations
  - Financial programs
  - All compatible with its OS ‚Üí manufacturers need Microsoft more than Microsoft needs them

**Profitability**:
- 15% average ROIC
- $52 billion in capital (all equity, no debt)
- Value comes from cash and software

**Sources**:
- Captive customers (expensive/time-consuming to switch)
- Economies of scale (writing software is mostly fixed cost)
- Network effect (product value increases with user base)

Apple (integration strategy) competes against Microsoft (market-specific advantage)  
Since IBM introduced the PC, Apple‚Äôs market share never exceeded 13% ‚Äî especially after Windows

---

### Competitive Advantages: PC Manufacturing Segment

- Changes in dominant firm over time ‚Üí low share stability
- If average share change >5%, no barriers to entry; if <2%, strong barriers

**Profitability measures**:
- Income as % of revenue
- EBIT as % of employed resources

Dell:
- Similar profitability
- More efficient overall
- Potential to create EoS through sales and marketing ops due to leadership and ops efficiency

**Sources**:
- No proprietary technology
- Same set of suppliers (except Apple)
- No EoS

If one firm were to emerge dominant, it would be Dell ‚Äî  
But overall, manufacturing has not been the profit-driving segment of the industry
