## Part 1: Vision

**Lean Startup** is an approach to building new businesses that emphasizes experimentation and iteration.

- Startups grow through feedback loops between the market/customers and the company.
- Instead of following a rigid plan, startups adapt continuously.
- The flow is: **Vision → Strategy → Product**

**Vision**: What is your world-changing idea?  
**Strategy**: Business model, roadmap, target audience  
**Product**: Result of executing strategy

- Vision is stable; strategy can change; product evolves constantly.
- Traditional businesses scale a single idea; modern ones create "innovation factories."
- Startups are experiments. The key question is: *Is this product worth making?*

### Designing the Experiment

- Split the vision into two hypotheses:
  - **Value Hypothesis**: Does this provide value to users?
  - **Growth Hypothesis**: How will new users discover it?
- Build a **Concierge MVP** to test both hypotheses early.
- Every team member should ask:
  1. Are users aware of the problem?
  2. Would they use a solution?
  3. Would they buy it from us?
  4. Can we build it?

> Most people jump to question 4. Start with 1–3.

**Example – Village Laundry Service**  
Instead of building a chain, they tested demand using a mobile truck with laundry machines. They observed what customers cared about, what they paid for, and what concerns they had.

## Part 2: Steering

**Turning vision into direction:**

- Feedback loop: **Idea → Build → Product → Measure → Data → Learn**
- All roles work together in the loop.
- Optimize the loop for speed and minimal waste.

### Key Concepts

- Focus on testing your **riskiest assumptions** first.
- Use MVPs for fast, targeted learning.
- Validate with **Innovation Accounting** — track progress with milestones and metrics.
- If metrics stall, consider a **pivot**.

### Pivot Types

| Type               | Description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Zoom In            | Make a single feature into the whole product          |
| Zoom Out           | Original product becomes a feature of a new product   |
| Customer Segment   | Shift to a more appropriate audience                  |
| Customer Need      | Tackle a new problem                                  |
| Platform           | Switch between app and platform                       |
| Business Model     | Change from low-margin/high-volume to opposite        |
| Revenue Model      | Rethink how money is made                             |
| Growth Engine      | Switch between viral/sticky/paid                      |
| Channel            | Change distribution method                            |
| Technology         | Solve the same problem with different tech            |

## Design & Customer Archetype

- Goal of early interactions: understand user pain points.
- Build a **customer archetype** and tailor product for them.
- **Early Adopters** tolerate rough edges and give valuable feedback.

> Don't stop if your MVP fails. Iterate based on feedback.

---

## Innovation Accounting

Track your learning through data.

### Stages:
1. Use MVP to gather baseline data
2. Tune the engine
3. Decide whether to pivot

You can use one MVP per hypothesis or one that tests many assumptions.

---

**Example – IMVU**

- Initially improved features blindly.
- Started measuring:
  - Signups, downloads, repeat use, purchases.
- Spent $5/day on Google Ads for quick data.
- Interviewed users.
- Discovered that product wasn’t positioned right.

---

## Cohort Analysis

- Study user behavior by time-based cohorts (e.g., Feb signups).
- Reveals what actually improves user retention.
- Key to **Split Testing** and validating new features.

**Tools like Kanban** help track validation stages, improving workflow and engaging engineers early.

### Actionable Data (The 3 A's)

| Principle   | Meaning                                                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Actionable  | Shows clear cause-and-effect                                           |
| Accessible  | Understandable to the whole team                                       |
| Auditable   | Can be trusted, traced to real-world behavior                          |

Avoid vanity metrics (like total users); focus on what drives learning and growth.

---

## Pivot Conferences

Hold regular strategic reviews to decide: pivot or persevere?

- Look for failed experiments, plateaued results.
- Include product + leadership teams.
- Use consistent metrics and formats.

---

## Part 3: Accelerate

### Small vs. Large Batches

- Small batches (like stuffing one envelope at a time) reduce risk and speed up learning.
- In startups, small teams from all departments should:
  - Build → Measure → Learn quickly
  - Identify and fix issues early
  - Communicate and iterate in tight loops

---

### Organizational Growth & Process

- Shift from producing everything to **pull-based** demand fulfillment.
- Accelerate prototyping using digital tools, 3D printing, etc.
- Design systems that let teams self-correct.

---

### Growth Engines

| Engine Type  | Description                                         | Metrics                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Sticky       | Focus on user retention, reduce churn               | Return rate, attrition vs acquisition    |
| Viral        | Growth via referrals                                | Referral ratio, viral coefficient        |
| Paid         | Growth through ads funded by profit                 | Revenue per customer vs CAC              |

> Regardless of engine, focus on delighting customers.

### Five Whys (Root Cause Analysis)

Ask "Why?" five times to trace issues to their root cause.  
Always involve team and focus on fixing systems, not blaming people.

---

### Destructive Innovation & Sandboxing

Create protected environments for disruptive experiments:

- Control scope (duration, users, impact)
- Use shared success metrics
- Run from start to finish
- Pull in only necessary teams
- Stop immediately if risk emerges
