*Pretotype*: (shortened ver of pretendotype) stripped-down version of a product, used to merely
validate interest

**Online Summary (Super concise & organized)**

This book is fairly easy to summarise, and its central theses are easy to digest.

- *The Law of Market Failure*: the vast majority of new businesses fail.

- *The Right It*: These failures are because of many reasons, but a key one is because
oftentimes markets don‚Äôt buy the business‚Äôs premise, i.e. businesses are often solving
the Wrong It.

Data Beats Opinions:

- In order to predict the future success of a planned venture, data beats opinions.
- Your own data is all that counts; other people‚Äôs data is meaningless.
- People‚Äôs opinions do not matter since they have no skin in the game.

- *Market Engagement Hypothesis*: In order to gather data on whether one‚Äôs solving the
Right It, one must seek to prove a hypothesis about the premise of the business, for
instance, in case of the original idea for Netflix, quoting from the book‚Äôs Kindle edition.

  - Idea: By partnering with local universities, BusU will offer accredited college-level
classes taught by top-rated professors while transporting professionals to and
from work each day.

  - MEH: A lot of professionals with long commutes will pay university-level tuition to
take buses with classes.

- *XYZ Hypothesis*: It‚Äôs important to convert everything from English to Math; so convert
the MEH to a statement like so: at least X% of Y will Z. So, in the above case:

  - XYZ: At least 2% of working professionals with daily commutes of one hour or
longer each way will pay $3,000 to take an accredited ten-week class on BusU at
least once a year.

  - XYZ Hypothesis: The central theme of the book is the importance of testing through
something called pretotyping (introduced in the next bullet point). In order to test our
market engagement hypothesis, we must convert the above XYZ statement into
something we can test easily, quickly, and at the lowest possible cost. The idea is to
convert the capital X, Y, and Z to small x, y, and z, by zooming into a local market where
a quick and inexpensive test can be conducted. So, in the above case.

- At least 40% of Google engineers commuting from San Francisco to Mountain
View who hear about BusU will visit the BusU4Google.com website and submit
their google.com email address to be informed of upcoming classes. (because
the writer used that commute and worked at Google)

*Personal note: Remember the Powai Principle ‚Äî* Powai is not Mumbai, Mumbai is
not India. Sometimes what is local is not indicative of any market beyond that
idiosyncratic market. Ensure your local market is representative of a larger
market. This is particularly true for operations-heavy industries.


*Pretotyping*: The central theme of the book. Before diving into running a venture or
building expensive prototypes, make smaller pretotypes that help you get your own data
to validate your xyz hypothesis, and by extension your XYZ hypothesis, and by
extension, your market engagement hypothesis. The difference between a pretotype and
a prototype is that pretotypes are quick, easy, inexpensive, and get you the data you
need to know whether to solve the problem, whereas prototypes are expensive,
time-consuming, and harder to make, and mainly serve the purpose of showing your
ability to solve the problem. Some examples of pretotypes follow. These can be used in
isolation or together.

- *The Mechanical Turk*: Build something that pretends to do what your high-tech
product would do, but with low to no tech. See how many people bite.

- *The Pinocchio*: Make a zero-tech, zero-functionality doppelganger to see if you /
your market would use the product to begin with.

- *The Fake Door*: Ask people to express interest. If your hypothesis is a certain
percentage of people will express interest, this should prove/disprove it.

- *The Facade*: Same as the Fake Door, except when people click the CTA, they
get a lesser version of the final product for a (maybe discounted) price.

- *The YouTube*: Show people a video showing the product in use and have them
either express interest or pre-order.

- *The One-Night Stand*: Use a limited-time, limited-space version of your final
idea to test your initial hypothesis, e.g. Airbnb and only one apartment on
Craigslist.

- *The Infiltrator*: Sneak your product into an existing marketplace where similar
products exist.

- *The Relabel*: When people express interest to buy, take a competitive product
and repackage it as yours to see if people buy its positioning.

In case of the BusU example, for instance:
- After an email was sent introducing the idea, a guy responded saying this: | have
a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from Berkeley, and | already have a ten-hour ‚ÄúIntro
to Machine Learning‚Äù minicourse that I‚Äôve taught several times at both Berkeley
and Google (to great reviews, average 4.8/5.0). This would be a lot of fun for me,
so you don‚Äôt even have to pay me. When can we start?

- This meant the xyz statement could be tweaked to this: At least 10% of Google
engineers commuting from San Francisco to Mountain View will pay $300 for a
one-week ‚ÄúIntroduction to Machine Learning‚Äù class on the bus taught by a fellow
Google employee. If proven, this could further be iterated to finetune the
business model and bring us closer to confidence on the overall XYZ statement.

## Part 1: The Law of Market Failure**

- Even successful businesses like Microsoft and McDonalds have developed failed
products (ex: McLobster, Google Answers)

Why? No matter how well-executed, most ideas are bad seeds and will not
succeed


*FLOP*: Failure due to...
- Launch: Good product, but failed marketing efforts/people didn‚Äôt notice
- Operations: Good product, right launch, but product wasn‚Äôt built well
(quality/functionality issues)
- Premise: Good launch, quality, and maybe some initial traction, but people
realized that it ultimately wasn‚Äôt the product they needed

Launch & operations can be remedied, but bad premise is a dead end

## Part 3: Put Thoughts Aside & Collect Data

Do not get lost in thoughtland > questions & personal opinions are biased and will not
validate the product, can create false hope or despair
Good, reliable data fits the following criteria:
- Freshness: Truths from a few years, months, weeks ago may not be true
anymore
- Relevance: Data from other ventures/similar fields may look related, but they are often not applicable to your business
- Known source: dangerous to rely on data collected for other projects because it is unknown how that data was produced & presented in a way that benefits their
product
- Statistical validity: data such as personal experiences or one-time occurrences
are not valid

## Part 4: Thinking Tools

XYZ method for creating testable hypotheses (X, Y, Z are unknown variables)
- X: How big of a piece (what percent) of the target market can we take up?
- Y: What is our target market?
- Z: How and to what extent will the target market respond to our product?
- Hypothetical numbers don‚Äôt have to be accurate, it‚Äôs the exact defining of what
we want to know & removal of ambiguities that make this effective
- Helps decide on factors such as reasonable price point

Example of XYZ method
- Idea: Uber but laundry (pick up and delivery service)
- Ambiguous market hypothesis: Most people who use the coin laundry don‚Äôt like
how much time it takes. Most of those people will pay an extra few bucks for
someone to pick up, launder, and return their items in a reasonable time.
- XYZ hypothesis: At least 10% of coin laundry users will pay $5 for a service that picks up and returns laundry within 24 hours.
  
The only way to know if an idea will 100% succeed is to develop a product & try to sell it on the market using a marketing campaign

- Pretotyping helps do this without losing resources because it precedes the
product & pretends like the product while providing similar customer experience
- Prototyping tests if we can actually make the product & ideal build, while
pretotype tests the solution itself
  - Will I use this product?
  - When, where, & how often will I use it?
- Will others buy it?
- How much will people be willing to pay?
- When, where, & how often will they use it?

Example of pretotyping
- IBM wanted to test a new voice typing software idea, but it would take years to develop
    - Tested it by putting a professional typist behind a computer, & told people that the system was an automated software
    - At first, people loved it, but later on in the testing many difficulties were discovered & company didn‚Äôt have to spend years developing product

## Part 5: Pretotyping Tools

3 criteria for pretotypes
- Produces my own data through active participation of customerss

### Active Investment Chart

| Type of Evidence                     | Example                                      | Investment Points |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Opinion (professional or not)        | ‚ÄúFantastic idea.‚Äù / ‚ÄúNo one will buy this.‚Äù  | 0                 |
| Unused/fake email or phone number    | bogusemail@spam.com / (123) 555-1212         | 0                 |
| Social media comments or likes       | ‚ÄúThis idea sucks.‚Äù / Likes/Dislikes          | 0                 |
| Online/offline surveys, interviews   | ‚ÄúRate how likely you are to buy (1‚Äì5).‚Äù      | 0                 |
| Real email for updates               | Submitting email for product info            | 1                 |
| Real phone number for updates        | Submitting number for follow-up call         | 10                |
| Time investment                      | Joining a 30-minute demo                     | 30 (1 point/min)  |
| Cash deposit                         | $50 to join a waitlist                       | 50 (1 point/$)    |
| Order                                | $250 for one of 10 early-release units       | 250 (1 point/$)   |

## Part 6: Analyzing Tools
- Collecting our own data based on active investment is crucial, but we also have to
extract value from that data by interpreting, measuring, comparing, and combining it
- Every time an iteration of testing is completed, resulting data is compared to the initial
hypothesis (how similar?) and added as an arrow onto the following chart
  - Asimprovements are made in every iteration, the arrows should get higher to the very likely mark

- One experiment is not enough to determine success rate of product
  - Testing Idea 1 might indicate that it is very unlikely
  - If so, go back to the beginning and examine the data to improve on your idea
  - Test multiple improved versions of the product and mark them as arrows on the chart again, should see gradual improvement
  - Even if idea tests very likely, various experiments must be done/repeated to ensure that it really is the right idea

## Part 8: Good Example- Bus U
Because Bay Area traffic is brutal and silicon valley engineers take hours to commute, the author came up with an idea to offer live Al learning courses on a commuting bus

Steps to collecting & utilizing data (uses thinking tools, pretotyping tools, and analyzing
tools) (example is outlined in blue text above)
1. Explain the original Bus U idea
2. Validate the initial market engagement hypothesis
3. Write the market hypothesis in the form of an XYZ hypothesis
4. Narrow the scope of the hypothesis to create a rapidly testable xyz hypothesis
5. Find pretotyping experiments to test the hypothesis
6. Strategically prioritize order of experiments based on distance, time, cost, etc. to resulting data
7. Execute first experiment
8. Based on our own data from first experiment(s), decide next steps
