title: "🗒️ Quality Investing"
description: "Notes from Chapters 1–4"
---

## Introduction

**3 indicators of quality:**
- Strong, predictable cash generation  
- Sustainable high ROIC  
- Attractive growth opportunities  

Critical link between growth and value creation: **ROI**  
Share prices tend to follow earnings over the long term → more capital deployed at higher rates of return → greater earnings growth → higher company value

Valuation premiums of quality companies reflect expected operational outperformance, but actual performance often exceeds expectations over time → underpriced stocks

---

## Chapter 1: Building Blocks

### Case: L’Oreal (Beauty/Cosmetics)
- Consistent organic sales growth (~6%)  
- Strong ROIC (gradually increasing, mid–high teens)  
- Strong cash conversion over 20 years  
- Stock compounded at 11% → 1000% increase  
- Heavy R&D and A&P investment  
- Acquisitions with attractive returns  
- Excess capital used for dividends and buybacks (10%+)  
- Combination of: supportive industry structure, growth-oriented management, differentiated offerings, and competitive advantages

### Capital Allocation

**4 ways to allocate capital:**
1. CapEx for growth / R&D, A&P  
2. M&A  
3. Dividends  
4. Buybacks  

#### Growth CapEx
- Not maintenance CapEx  
- H&M opened 1+ outlet daily in 2014, solid returns on new stores doubled EPS  
- Sustaining high returns on incremental CapEx leads to compound growth

#### R&D + A&P
- Unilever’s Dove: marketing built consumer captivity  
- Maintenance vs. brand-building expenditures  
- Advertising = flexible expense  
- R&D is future investment  
- Best gauge of R&D effectiveness = historical returns

#### M&A
- Often destroys value  
- Valuable in certain contexts:
  - Industry consolidation (Essilor)  
  - Buying strong business (Luxottica + Oakley)  
  - Network leverage (Diageo expanding global brands)  
- **Red flags**: diversification, scale for scale’s sake, rapid execution

#### Dividends & Buybacks
- Use excess cash  
- Bad timing = value destruction (expansionary buybacks, downturn stinginess)  
- Favor transparency in policy disclosures  

---

### The Costs of Working Capital
- Working capital: short-term assets (inventory) – liabilities (accounts payable)  
- Tied-up resources delay cash  
- High WC burden = weak bargaining power  
- Low incremental WC = high value creation  
- Rarely negative (except prepay-based models like software, insurance)

---

### Return on Capital

**Why it matters:**
- Reflects industrial positioning + capital efficiency  
- ROE = crude measure (can be distorted by leverage, accounting tricks)  
- ROIC / CROCCI / CFROI better reflect capital effectiveness  
- Look for high, stable historical returns

#### Asset Turns
- Indicates capital intensity  
- Asset-light models (franchises, software) = attractive but can attract competition

#### Profit Margins
- Gross margin = best measure of product valuation by consumer  
- High margins → leverage for R&D/A&P and cost buffering  
- Margin volatility = weak cost control

---

## Multiple Sources of Growth

- Best businesses in growing end-markets with reliable demand

### Gaining Market Share
- Independent of economy  
- Controlled through ads, stores, distribution  
- As share increases, gains harder  
- Good if growth is from identifiable competitor

### Geographic Expansion
- Common for plateauing domestic firms  
- Past success = positive indicator  
- Case: Unilever – 60% rev from emerging markets via local longevity

### Pricing, Mix, Volume
- **Price increase**: rare, limited to inelastic segments  
- **Mix optimization**: premium packaging  
- **Volume-based growth**: lowest quality, unless high margin/op leverage

### Cyclical Market Growth
- Look for real earnings through cycles  
- Understand cycles to reduce risk

### Structural Growth
- Often cyclical in disguise, but anchored in trends

### Persistence of Growth
- Earnings growth less correlated with past than asset/sales growth  
- 10–15% EPS growth more sustainable  
- Stable ROIC/CFROI = strong indicator

---

## Good Management

### Disciplined Stewards
- Patience with organic growth, restraint on large M&A  
- Counter-cyclical investment (during recessions)

### Independent & Long-Term
- Example: Rolls-Royce developing Trent engine  
- Constant improvement, clear vision

### Avoid the Spotlight
- Award-winning CEOs tend to underperform afterward

### People Matter
- Great firms develop great managers (GE, IBM)

### Candor
- Direct, honest investor communication

---

## Industry Structure

### Mini-Monopolies
- Exist in consumers’ minds/preferences  
- Ex: tobacco, where brand loyalty drives competition

### Partial Monopolies
- Competition only in certain segments  
- Ex: Ambev in Brazil (50% EBITDA) vs. global competitors

### Oligopolies
- Coke vs. Pepsi > Airbus vs. Boeing  
- Focus on stable, logical coexistence

### Barriers to Entry
- Not just about entering, but scaling and succeeding  
- Good signs: few new entrants, family ownership (long-term thinking)

---

## Customer Benefits

### Intangible Benefits
- Taste, image, identity-driven  
- L’Oreal leverages this with R&D and 70% margin durable products

### Assurance Benefits
- High failure cost = premium pricing sustained

### Convenience Benefits
- Bundled services, easy renewal, sticky systems

### Customer Types
- Retail = price sensitive and emotional  
- Corporate = objective, cost/efficiency-focused

---

## Competitive Advantage

### Technology
- Needs to be **sustainable**, not just novel  
- Defensive moats: R&D spend, data, speed, integration

### Network Effects
- Value grows with user base  
- Ex: search engines, social media  
- But → risks of backlash or disruption (FB > MySpace)

### Distribution
- Middlemen partnerships or service networks critical in some products

---

## Chapter 2: Patterns

### Recurring Revenue Models

#### Recurring Revenue Benefits
- Locked-in, high-margin, high-stability  
- Predictable CFs even in cyclicality

#### Product Upfront Challenges
- Costly without recurring offset  
- Barrier for new entrants

#### Revenue Models
- **License**: steady fees (software)  
- **Service**: MRO post-sale  
- **Subscription**: weakest unless highly embedded

#### Case: KONE (Elevators)
- Oligopoly with required maintenance  
- Strong density and network = no downturn impact

---

### Friendly Middlemen

- Value-add experts (optometrists, plumbers)  
- Lock-in through recommendation and complexity

---

### Toll Roads & Gold Standards

- Toll roads = value capture per unit (credit ratings, software certs)  
- Magic ingredients: small input, big impact (ex: yogurt cultures)

---

### Low-Price Plus & Case Studies

#### Ryanair
- Lowest cost by far  
- Secondary airports, efficient ops  
- Free press via controversy

#### Costco
- Every element optimized for savings  
- Limited products, rural sheds, membership-driven

#### Banks
- Commodity-like but strong banks = stable capital and returns

---

## Pricing Power

- Quiet power = durable power  
- Gross margin trends indicate pricing ability

#### Case: Hermes
- Artisanal scarcity, heritage, exclusivity

#### Pricing for Value
- Monsanto: 1–2% yield improvements = higher prices

---

## Brand Strength

- **Heritage**: legacy and roots  
- **Trust**: brand as promise (ex: McDonalds)  
- **Case: Diageo** – powerful portfolio + storytelling

---

## Scale Advantage

- Direct distribution, retailer influence  
- Halo effect for distributors

---

## Market Share Gainers

- Power compounds with growth  
- Exceptions exist: pricing power > share sometimes

#### Case: Fielmann
- Partnered with insurer for luxury frame access  
- Scale + backward integration

---

## Global Capabilities

- Model adaptation across borders  
- Inditex: biweekly fashion drops, regional sourcing

---

## Corporate Culture

- Cost-consciousness, scientific curiosity  
- Families: long-term, conservative funding  
- Self-perpetuating cultures

---

## Cost to Replicate

- Invert: what would it take to copy?  
- Ex: Experian’s irreplicable dataset

---

## Chapter 3: Pitfalls

### Cyclicality
- Avoid deeply cyclical (mining, energy)  
- Flow products > capital goods

### Innovation Risk
- Disruption > more losers than winners  
- Fast innovation is fragile

### Dependency
- Governments: risk of taxes/controls  
- Customers: concentrated = risky (ex: F&B/grocery chains)

### New Entrants & Trade
- Open trade + e-commerce = new competition

### Changing Customer Preferences
- Fashion risk, good-enough goods  
- Private label vs. branded products

---

## Chapter 4: Implementation

### Challenges
- Long-term compounding > short-term pressures  
- Accept underperformance  
- Be qualitative in a data-driven world  
- Be boring in a loud market
