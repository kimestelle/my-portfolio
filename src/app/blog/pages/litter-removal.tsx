        We were driving to work when my mom noticed a guy picking up trash by the side of the road.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Look at him,&quot; she nudged. &quot;How could he be such a good person?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
        Then we passed one of those signs: Litter Removal Provided By [His Name, I think].
        </p>
        <p>
            She blinked and took the comment back; not with judgment, just a shift in tone. Like the goodness got diluted once it was part of a neighborhood program.
        </p>
        <p>
            I asked her why it didn&apos;t count anymore when it was the same action and street. She paused for a bit and said that maybe it still counted. She didn&apos;t explain further, but that moment stuck through the drive.

            I&apos;ve been thinking about how we talk about goodness. How much of it depends on effort. On going out of your way into discomfort. It&apos;s similar to what I tell my college counseling students to emphasize in their community impact essays so they can stand out as sincere and self-driven.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like goodness counts more when it&apos;s inconvenient.
        </p>
        <p>
            But most of the good I&apos;ve seen doesn&apos;t come from sacrifice. It comes from space, someone having enough time, guidance, or energy to act on what they already care about.
        </p>
        <p>
            That guy was probably more effective and consistent than someone doing it once on a whim. But it didn&apos;t feel that way in the moment because we saw the system that made it easier to do good before the person who did it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sign, that pause, and the weird feeling that some kinds of care are harder to spot when they come with infrastructure.
