                    Hi!
                </h2>

                I&apos;m a rising sophomore at UPenn striving to create accessible, intuitive digital spaces that empower people.
                <br/><br/>
                Previously, long-running impacts through social impact projects. Technology gave me an unbounded canvas; I want to share that freedom with others while exploring the field.
                <br/><br/>
                I love learning a little about everything, singing and arranging music with my a capella, playing amateur guitar, all kinds of seafood, and taking odd pictures.
                <br/><br/>
                Let&apos;s connect! I&apos;d love to hear more about you.
                </p>
