                    Hi!
                </h2>
            </div>
                <p className='text-sm'>
                I&apos;m a rising sophomore at UPenn striving to create accessible, intuitive digital spaces that empower people.
                <br/><br/>
                Previously, I designed sustainable and people-oriented solutions for my communities through legislation and grassroots organizing. Technology gave me an unbounded canvas; I&apos;m excited to explore and get involved in the field.
                <br/><br/>
                I love learning a little about everything, singing and arranging music with my a capella, playing amateur guitar, all kinds of seafood, and taking odd pictures.
                <br/><br/>
                Let&apos;s connect! I&apos;d love to hear more about you.
                </p>
