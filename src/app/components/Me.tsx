                    Hi!
                </h2>
            </div>
                <p className='text-sm'>
                I&apos;m a rising college sophomore interested in creating beautiful, functional, and intuitive technology that empowers all people.
                <br/><br/>
                I&apos;ve always been drawn to designing spaces that transform people and leave long-running impacts through social impact projects. Technology gave me an unbounded canvas; I want to share that freedom with others while learning all I can.
                <br/><br/>
                I love learning a little about everything, singing and arranging music with my a capella, playing amateur guitar, all kinds of seafood, and taking odd pictures.
                <br/><br/>
                Let&apos;s connect! I&apos;d love to hear more about you.
                </p>
