The project was completed in with two team members across three milestones, focusing on modularity, optimization, and engaging graphics.\n\nMy Contributions:\n\nTerrain Rendering and Chunking:\n  - Designed a chunk-based system to optimize terrain rendering by dynamically loading and unloading visible chunks based on the playerâ€™s position.\n  - Developed interleaved Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) to efficiently store and render chunk geometry, ensuring only visible faces were processed, reducing GPU load.\n\nTexture Mapping and Animation:\n  - Mapped block textures with UV coordinates, including distinct faces for blocks like grass (top, sides, bottom).\n  - Implemented animated textures for water and lava using time-dependent transformations, creating smooth, looping motions.\n  - Debugged and refined the texture rendering pipeline, ensuring compatibility with the interleaved VBO structure.\n\nDynamic Sky:\n  - Built a custom sky shader featuring:\n    - A procedurally animated day-night cycle with moving sun.\n    - Animated clouds using Worley noise and fractional Brownian motion.\n\nFluid Surface Waves and Reflection:\n  - Developed realistic water and lava wave simulations by dynamically displacing vertex positions in the shader using sine and cosine functions.\n  - Recalculated normals in the vertex shader to accurately reflect light on moving surfaces.\n  - Enhanced visibility of movement with Blinn-Phong highlights.",

  "- Developed a minimal and responsive web interface, ensuring ease of use while incorporating subtle animations to give the screen life.\n" +
  "- Created a customizable duck avatar and letter block, designed to attract user interaction through playful, tangible draggable objects.\n" +
  "\nDevelopment Challenges:\n" +
  "- Efficient algorithm to source a dictionary subset from 7 letters, including a pangram, by processing and sorting a large dictionary (46,444 words) and indexing it by letter + creating a separate source of pangrams to pull the letters from.\n" +
  "- Drag-and-drop functionality for the duck graphics, ensuring they could be seamlessly cloned/dragged onto words and reordered dynamically using painstaking CSS details and npm packages.\n" +
  "- Complex game and user data states, appropriate caching to maintain performance across gameplay sessions.\n" +
  "- JWT token management for secure user authentication and session persistence.\n" +
  "\nNext Steps:\n" +
  "- Deploy site\n" +
  "- Recover some animations gone MIA after restructuring app (ducks in pond randomly flapping, fly and sink animations upon entering word).\n",
