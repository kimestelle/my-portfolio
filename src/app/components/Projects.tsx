Final team project for CIS4600.\n\nMy Contributions:\n\nTerrain Rendering and Chunking:\n  - Designed a system to optimize infinite terrain rendering by dynamically loading and unloading visible chunks based on the playerâ€™s position.\n  - Developed interleaved Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) to efficiently store and render chunk geometry, ensuring only visible faces were processed, reducing GPU load.\n\nTexture Mapping and Animation:\n  - Mapped block textures with UV coordinates, including distinct faces for blocks like grass (top, sides, bottom).\n  - Implemented animated textures for water and lava using time-dependent transformations, creating smooth, looping motions.\n\nDynamic Sky:\n  - Built a GLSL sky shader featuring:\n    - A procedurally animated day-night cycle with moving sun and halo.\n    - Procedural clouds using Worley noise-based fractional Brownian motion.\n\nFluid Surface Waves and Reflection:\n  - Dynamically displaced water geometry to create realistic wave motion.\n  - Recalculated normals in the vertex shader to accurately reflect light on moving surfaces.\n  - Enhanced light reflections with Blinn-Phong highlights.",
